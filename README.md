# ⚠️ **Important Notice (All Users)**

### **EP03 — City Living**

### **EP06 — Get Famous**

These two DLC **cannot be downloaded automatically by Linua Updater**.

This is a **global technical limitation**:

* The available mirrors do **not support direct programmatic downloads**
* Both DLC are distributed as **multipart archives (.7z.001 / .002)**
* They require **manual confirmation**, which prevents automated retrieval

Because of this, **EP03 and EP06 must be installed manually by all users**, regardless of region or VPN.

A complete manual installation guide is provided below.

---

# **Manual Installation (EP03 & EP06)**

### **1. Download the archives**

Official verified mirrors:

* **EP03 — City Living**
  [https://gofile.io/d/7zzJA5](https://gofile.io/d/7zzJA5)

* **EP06 — Get Famous**
  [https://gofile.io/d/PJ6wc4](https://gofile.io/d/PJ6wc4)

---

### **2. Extract both archives**

Each archive contains exactly two folders:

```
EP03 (or EP06)
_Installer
```

---

### **3. Place the folders into your Sims 4 directory**

Your game folder is usually located at:

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\The Sims 4
```

Copy both folders into **The Sims 4** directory.

If Windows asks:
**“Replace the files in the destination?”** → choose **Replace**.

Repeat for the second DLC.

---

### **Correct folder structure after installation**

```
The Sims 4
├── EP03
├── EP06
├── _Installer
├── Game
├── Data
└── ...
```

---

### **4. Continue installation through Linua Updater**

* Open **Linua Updater**
* **Do NOT select EP03 or EP06**
* Select any other DLC you need
* Press **Update**
